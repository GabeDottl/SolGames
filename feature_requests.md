Not sure if your feature would fit? Think of the Solana Game Server as
like the 'Photon/NodeJS backends for Blockchain Gaming' (analogous to
Unity for graphic effects). Not replacing Solana or Unity, but sitting

the former in a secure and efficient way.

1. Card game Solana API (gabedottl@). (status: WIP as of Jan 2022).
2. Game-oriented, High speed, eventually consistent, semi-decentralized
   Serving API/frontend using Solana as settlement layer?
