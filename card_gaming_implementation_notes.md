# Mint Tardigrades (using Candy Machine(?))
https://docs.metaplex.com/candy-machine-v2/introduction (This took longer to find than I'd expect).
Features: Unpredictable mint index, whitelists, captcha integration, 

"Larger collections and hide-and-reveal drops: It is possible to create super large and hide-and-reveal drops by specifying a single hash, which is used by all mints. While the hash is the same across all mints, the name of each item is specified with a unique number, **allowing an off-chain process to later update the metadata with the actual item.**"
^All on-chain including initialization logic and system parameters?



platform-level note: Could do a hybrid approach - generate & push contract logic per-app to create an 'app in a box' on-chain combined with shared on-chain infrastructure. Platform apps get cheap rail-access?
