Solana Game Server* is the first decentralized Game Server designed for game developers & web3.

Web2 gaming today is entrenched by large game studios and aging freemium model franchises.

Web2 game models suck and web3 has the potential to unlock novel differentiation and monetization
mechanisms for small and large games alike. The most popular 'crypto games' today are limited in their complexity
by their blockchain (Ethereum) or the complexity of building secure, interesting blockchain-based
mechanics (Solana et al).

SGS endeavors to make it easier for game developers to take their web2 games and adapt them to
web3 with Solana by building the best, secure game-oriented smart contracts on Solana for
traditional game developers to leverage.

Code will be published here and deployed to Solana mainnet periodically. Fees (TBD) will be baked
into the smart contract. A CDN + Endpoint solution will be provided as a service using said fees.
The contract will allow creating custom coins and operating within the Solana Game Server. Code
& documentation is public by-default to encourage community involvement.

This will all be exposed either on-chain directly or via a SaaS generating & deploying contracts on-demand.

Possible games: card battles, turn-based X, breeding, land ownership, metaverse avatar customization

*Solana Game Server is not directly owned or maintained by Solana Labs. The name 'Solana Game Server'
is used instead of a codename to reduce ambiguity. Name suggestions welcome.

## What's the devnet address?
Not launched yet.

## What's the mainnet address?
Still not launched yet.

## Where's the IDL?!?
Not there.

## API locked?
Nope.

## Are there tests?
Without an API? Ofc not. We'll have unit, functional, and integration tests + code coverage as we build.

## Whats with the Tardigrades?
They're cute - see tardigrades.online.

## How can I help?
Reach out if you're a game developer interested in using our platform.

## Where's the Discord?
Avoiding the noise - checkout tardigrades.online for contact info, or make an issue here.

## Where's the latest info?
See Notes.md.

## Why is there a LICENSE?
Writing good software is hard and I'd like Tardigrade Life Sciences, Inc to be able to get funding from users. Also, businesses
(e.g. game studios, institutions) like working with other businesses with formal, contractual relationships. By giving leaving
ownership & management of these contracts to Tardigrade Life Sciences, my expectation/hope is to save many lost engineering
hours by game developers trying to build on Solana.

Many deployed smart contracts are pay-for-use, yet private source - which is undesireable for a 'trustless' network. I respect
wanting to maintain competitive edge by not sharing information with competitors, but I think at this stage in the ecosystem,
it's preferable to be trusted as the 'official' source over other projects which may (illegally) fork and commercialize without
licensing.

Please note, TLS is not presently associated with any venture funding as of January 2022.
