Solana Game Server is the first decentralized Game Server designed for web3 gaming.

The problem SolGames aims to solve is to make it possible and easy for traditional game developers using tools such as Unity, Unreal, etc. to use blockchain/crypto mechanics to build novel games ontop of the Solana platform.

SolGames provide a series of on-chain APIs and infrastructure to enable developers to rapidly build new blockchain experiences without having to directly write or deploy any smart contracts. Game developers should be focused on building the most delightful, engaging, global games - not figuring out decentralized infrastructure.

Code will be stored here first and published to mainnet periodically.
