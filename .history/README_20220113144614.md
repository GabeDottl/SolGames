Solana Game Server is the first decentralized Game Server designed for web3 gaming.

It can be thought of like a Gaming Virtual Machine running on the Solana network.

The problem SGS tries to solve is to make it possible and easy for traditional game developers using tools such as Unity, Unreal, etc. to use blockchain/crypto mechanics to build novel games ontop of the Solana platform.

This includes features of a game server such as maintaining decentralized, tamperproof game state, and providing secure/trustless execution by running on top of Solana.

SGS handles the hard bits to provide customizable game server environments for non-crypto game developers.

Code will be stored here and deployed to Solana mainnet periodically.
