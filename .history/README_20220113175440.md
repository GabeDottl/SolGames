Solana Game Server is the first decentralized Game Server designed for game developers & web3.

It makes it easier for game developers to take their web2 games and adapt them to web3.

Code will be published here and deployed to Solana mainnet periodically. Fees (TBD) will be baked
into the smart contract. The contract will allow creating custom coins and operating within the
Solana Game Server.

This will all be exposed either on-chain directly or via a SaaS generating contracts on-demand.

Possible games: card battles, turn-based X, breeding, land ownership, metaverse avatar customization
