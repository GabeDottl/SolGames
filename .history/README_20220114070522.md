Solana Game Server is the first decentralized Game Server designed for game developers & web3.

Web2 game models suck and web3 has the potential to unlock novel differentiation and monetization
mechanisms for small-games. The most popular 'crypto games' today are limited in their complexity
by their blockchain (Ethereum) or the complexity of building secure, interesting blockchain-based
mechanics (Solana et al).

SGS endeavors to make it easier for game developers to take their web2 games and adapt them to
web3 with Solana by building the best, secure game-oriented smart contracts on Solana for
traditional game developers to leverage.

Code will be published here and deployed to Solana mainnet periodically. Fees (TBD) will be baked
into the smart contract. The contract will allow creating custom coins and operating within the
Solana Game Server. Code & documentation is public by-default to encourage community involvement.

This will all be exposed either on-chain directly or via a SaaS generating & deploying contracts on-demand.

Possible games: card battles, turn-based X, breeding, land ownership, metaverse avatar customization

# FAQ
## How do I request features?
Make an Issue. Issues with offered eng-assistance are prioritized.

## What's the devnet address?
Not launched yet.

## What's the mainnet address?
Still not launched yet.

## Where's the IDL?!?
Not there.

## API locked?
Nope.

## Are there tests?
Without an API? Ofc not. We'll have unit, functional, and integration tests + code coverage as we build.

## Whats with the Tardigrades?
They're cute - see tardigrades.online.

## How can I help?
Reach out if you're a game developer interested in using our platform.

## Where's the Discord?
Avoiding the noise - checkout tardigrades.online for contact info, or make an issue here.

## Where's the latest info?
See Notes.md.

## Why is there a LICENSE?
Writing good software is hard and I'd like Tardigrade Life Sciences, Inc to be able to get funding from users.

Many deployed smart contracts pay-for-use, yet private source - which feels a bit absurd for a 'trustless' network. I respect
wanting to maintain competitive edge by not sharing information with competitors, but I think at this stage in the ecosystem,
it's preferable to be trusted as the 'official' source over other projects which may (illegally) fork and commercialize without
licensing.

Please note, TLS is not presently associated with any venture funding as of January 2022.
