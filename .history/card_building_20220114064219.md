Building card games with NFTs using Metaplex feels like a probable common use-case
- and a useful starting point.

Possible Needs:
* Define a deck of cards with counts and other universe*-specific attributes

*: Seems like defining groupings of games which are inter-compatible as 'universes'
makes sense. Need some 'group of compatible cards' name.

Possible Entities:
* A Universe: A collection of NFT assets which are in-game compatible.
* A Species: A collection of NFT assets which are breedable.
* A 

Game:
Tardigrades MTG-style. 
A Tardigrade card/instance/collectible/NFT can be defined as:
(version.visual_style.nft_cost.artist_universe.claw_count)

There are 3 key functions:
1) Mint Card using Candy Machine(?)
2) 'Battle' cards [delayed-trigger or instant?]

Ideal features:
* Minimum data
* Maximum number of concurrent, global players
* Minimum waiting for players (instant gratification)
* Long-term time-based effects
* 
* Functional backend+storage purely on solana+arweave (minus client assets)


Fun ideas:
* Editor is terminal or schema-based rather than web UI - better ergo & easier
