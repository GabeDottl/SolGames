Building card games with NFTs using Metaplex feels like a probable common use-case
- and an interesting starting experiment.

Needs:
* Define a deck of cards with counts and other universe*-specific attributes

*: Seems like defining groupings of games which are inter-compatible as 'universes' makes sense. Need some 'group of compatible cards' name.

Fun ideas:
* Editor is terminal or schema-based rather than web UI - better ergo & easier
