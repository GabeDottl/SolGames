# Path
Client (browser, mobile app, desktop app) -> plugin -> fast, segmented serving layers -> Solana API endpoints -> security-audited, public smart contracts -> Sealevel runtime (local, devnet, testnet, mainnet, web2)

SGS aims to provide servics to ease the path from Client -> Solana Sealevel runtime instance
