This repository is 'live' and focused on being the defacto 'decentralized game server' on Solana.

Cove is the author's old Yearn-like Vault built for Solana - and is a helpful strating point for
a game server.

# Useful commands
See docs/histfile.

I publish a sanitized, trimmed version of my terminal history to docs/histfile for an up-to-date
references - and historical reference/documentation. If you're wondering how to use some code -
that's a place to look.

Otherwise, I'll add APIs for these over time (feel free to add or fill-in with PRs).
